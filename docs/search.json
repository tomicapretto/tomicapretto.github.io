My place of work was at IMASL in San Luis, Argentina. I’m still a part-time PhD student.\nWhy Statistics?\nI’ve always felt curious about so many things that I couldn’t pick just one. So I studied Statistics. At that time I felt that something like statistics would give me the chance to work (and learn) with different problems from different fields and, consequently, I could chose to specialize in a particular field later in my career.\nNowadays, I am not only very happy to have chosen what I chose, but also eager to keep learning. Hopefully, one day I will be able to contribute with my share to the community and return something of all I have been taught.\nInterests\nStatistical learning\nBayesian statistics\nProgramming languages\nExploratory data analysis\nData visualization\nEducation\nPhD in Statistics - Universidad Nacional de Rosario - 2024 (expected)\nBSc in Statistics - Universidad Nacional de Rosario - 2019\n\n\n\n",
