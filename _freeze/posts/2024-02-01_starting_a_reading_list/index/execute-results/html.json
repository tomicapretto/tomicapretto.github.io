I didn't grow up in a place where reading was \nencouraged nor am I talking about books with people all the time, \nat least not to the extent that some friends do.\n\nBeing connected with so many people that always share excellent reading recommendations \nis great, but it has its downsides. In my case, I started to feel I was falling behind. \nStumbling upon countless must read books is as exciting as overwhelming.\n\nIt didn't take me long to realize that I actually read a significant amount of books, \nof all kinds, and that I shouldn't feel so bad for not being able to read everything. \nAt the end of the day, out of the multitude of titles that are released every year our \nfinite time allows us to read only a bunch of them.\n\nThe next question I asked myself was whether I read more books on statistics than on other\ntopics. Curiously, a first review of the latest books led me to conclude that most of the \nbooks I read have nothing to do with statistics. No shame in that, I really enjoy them.\n\nAt the same time I was doing this mental exercise, I realized it would be nice to keep a \nlist of the books I read. Until now, I always had to have a look at my bookshelf to become\naware of the books I read over time. \n\nI can only imagine positive outcomes for a reading list. It will make my reading be \nmore organized, consistent, and, why not, prolific. Also, it will be fun to see the \nevolution of my reading habits over time and share it with others.\n\nSo officially, today, I'm starting [a reading list](../../reading.qmd)! \n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n:::\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\"}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![Photo by <a href='https://unsplash.com/aaronburden'>Aaron Burden</a> on <a href='https://unsplash.com/photos/6jYoil2GhVk'>Unsplash</a>](reading.jpg){fig-align='center' width=70%}\n:::\n:::",
