I'm a Data Scientist at [PyMC-Labs](https://www.pymc-labs.io/) and a part-time Statistics PhD student.
<br>
I speak mainly Python and R, but I'm also experienced with other languages and tools as well.
<br>
I'm an Open Source Software developer, mostly focusing on [Bambi](https://github.com/bambinos/bambi).
