I use data science to solve problems at [PyMC Labs](https://www.pymc-labs.io/), <br>
I teach statistics at Universidad Nacional de Rosario,<br>
and because I'm always learning, I'm still a (part-time) PhD student.
<br>
I'm also an Open Source Software developer, mostly focusing on [Bambi](https://github.com/bambinos/bambi).
<br>
I speak mainly Python and R, but I'm also experienced with other languages and tools as well.
