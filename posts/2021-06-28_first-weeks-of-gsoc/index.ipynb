    "## Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "My project is called **Extend available models and default priors in Bambi**. The main goal of this project is to add new families of generalized linear \n",
    "models, such as beta regression, robust linear regression (i.e. linear model with error following a T-Student distribution)^[These two distributions are not members of the exponential family so using them as the distribution of the random component does not result in a generalized linear model in a strict sense. But I would usually refer to them as GLMs since the linear predictor, link function, and random component properties are still present.] as well as multinomial regression. However, this raises a second problem, which is about default priors distributions. \n",
    "\n",
    "Default priors in Bambi are limited to the families implemented in the [GLM](https://www.statsmodels.org/stable/glm.html) module in[statsmodels](https://www.statsmodels.org/), which does not include the families mentioned above. For this reason, it is first necessary to incorporate alternative automatic priors so new families work without requiring the user to manually specify priors.\n",
    "\n",
    "Therefore, these first weeks of the coding period were centered around understanding how default priors work on other high-level modeling packages such as [brms](https://paul-buerkner.github.io/brms/) and [rstanarm](https://mc-stan.org/rstanarm/), how to translate their ideas into [PyMC3](https://docs.pymc.io/) code, and finally how to implement everything within Bambi."

    "## Alternative default priors\n",
    "\n",
    "Currently, Bambi uses maximum likelihood estimates in the construction of its default priors. There are two limitations associated with this approach. First, current default priors don't exist whenever uniquely identifiable maximum likelihood estimates don't exist (e.g. $p > n$ or complete separation scenarios). Secondly, these estimates are obtained via the GLM module in statsmodels, which means default priors can only be obtained for families made available in statsmodels.\n",
    "\n",
    "Based on the available documentation and simulations I've done, I decided to implement alternative default priors that are much like the [default priors in rstanarm](https://mc-stan.org/rstanarm/articles/priors.html). These priors aim to be weakly-informative in most scenarios and do not depend on maximum likelihood estimates. Their documentation is excellent and it was a great guide for my implementation. \n",
    "\n",
    "[This](https://github.com/bambinos/bambi/pull/360) is the PR where I implement alternative default priors inspired on rstanarm default priors. In addition, I also implement LKJ prior for the correlation matrices of group-specific effects. "

    "Group-specific effects can now have non-independent priors. Instead of using independent normal distributions, we can use a multivariate normal distribution whose correlation matrix has an LKJ prior distribution. This distribution depends on a parameter $\\eta > 0$. If $\\eta=1$, the LJK prior is jointly uniform over all correlation matrices of the same dimension. If $\\eta >1$ increases, the mode of the distribution is the identity matrix. The larger the value of $\\eta$ the more sharply peaked the density is at the identity matrix.\n",
