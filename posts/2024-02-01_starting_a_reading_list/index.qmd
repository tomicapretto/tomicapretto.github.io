I never considered myself a bookworm. I didn't grow up in a place where reading was 
encouraged nor am I talking about books with people all the time, 
at least not to the extent that some friends do.

Being connected with so many people that always share excellent reading recommendations 
is great, but it has its downsides. In my case, I started to feel I was falling behind. 
Stumbling upon countless must read books is as exciting as overwhelming.

It didn't take me long to realize that I actually read a significant amount of books, 
of all kinds, and that I shouldn't feel so bad for not being able to read everything. 
At the end of the day, out of the multitude of titles that are released every year, our 
finite time allows us to read only a bunch of them.

The next question I asked myself was whether I read more books on statistics than on other
topics. Curiously, a first review of the latest books led me to conclude that most of the 
books I read have nothing to do with statistics. No shame in that, I really enjoy them.

At the same time I was doing this mental exercise, I realized it would be nice to keep a 
list of the books I read. Until now, I always had to have a look at my bookshelf to become
aware of the books I read over time. 

I can only imagine positive outcomes for a reading list. It will make my reading be 
more organized, consistent, and, why not, prolific. Also, it will be fun to see the 
evolution of my reading habits over time and share it with others.

So officially, today, I'm starting [a reading list](../../reading.qmd)!
